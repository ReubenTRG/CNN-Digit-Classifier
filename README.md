# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN (Python)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using **Python and TensorFlow/Keras** to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from 28×28 grayscale images.

It also includes an **interactive drawing canvas** where users can draw a digit with the mouse and the model predicts the number in real time.
